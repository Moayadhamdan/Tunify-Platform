# Tunify Platform

## Introduction

Tunify Platform is an Empty .NET Core Web Application to enhance your music experience. It allows users to create and manage playlists, explore various songs, albums, and artists, and subscribe to different subscription plans. With Tunify Platform, you can organize your favorite songs into playlists, discover new music, and keep track of your musical journey.

## Overview of Relationships

The Tunify Platform database schema is structured to maintain a well-organized and efficient relationship between various entities. Below is an overview of the relationships between the entities in the Tunify Platform:

1. **Users**
   - Each user is uniquely identified by UserId.
   - Users have a one-to-many relationship with playlists, meaning a user can create multiple playlists.
   - Each user has a subscription identified by SubscriptionId.

2. **Subscriptions**
   - Subscriptions are uniquely identified by SubscriptionId.
   - Each subscription has a type and a price.
   - Users are linked to subscriptions via SubscriptionId.

3. **Playlists**
   - Playlists are uniquely identified by PlaylistId.
   - Each playlist is associated with a specific user via UserId.
   - Playlists have a one-to-many relationship with PlaylistSongs, meaning a playlist can contain multiple songs.

4. **Songs**
   - Songs are uniquely identified by SongId.
   - Each song is associated with an artist and an album via ArtistId and AlbumId respectively.
   - Songs have a many-to-many relationship with playlists, managed through the PlaylistSongs table.

5. **Albums**
   - Albums are uniquely identified by AlbumId.
   - Each album is associated with an artist via ArtistId.

6. **Artists**
   - Artists are uniquely identified by ArtistId.
   - Artists can have multiple albums.

7. **PlaylistSongs**
   - The PlaylistSongs table serves as a junction table for the many-to-many relationship between playlists and songs.
   - Each entry in PlaylistSongs is uniquely identified by PlaylistSongsId and contains foreign keys to PlaylistId and SongId.

In summary, the database design ensures a flexible and scalable structure, allowing users to manage their musical content efficiently while maintaining the integrity and relationships of the data.

## The Repository Design Pattern

### Overview of the Repository Pattern

The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that encapsulates the logic needed to access data sources, providing a central place to manage data access. It abstracts the data layer from the rest of the application by acting as a mediator between the domain and data mapping layers. In essence, the Repository Pattern allows the application to communicate with the database through well-defined methods, making the application more modular and easier to maintain.

### Benefits of the Repository Pattern

1. **Separation of Concerns:** The Repository Pattern separates the data access logic from the business logic, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code. It keeps the business logic in controllers or services and relegates data operations to repositories.

2. **Improved Testability:** By using repositories, you can easily mock the data layer during unit testing. This allows you to test your business logic independently of the actual database.

3. **Centralized Data Access Logic:** Repositories centralize the data access logic for a particular entity in one place. This reduces code duplication and ensures that data access logic is consistent across the application.

4. **Flexibility and Scalability:** The Repository Pattern allows you to change the underlying data source without affecting the business logic. This makes your application more flexible and scalable, as you can switch databases or use different data storage mechanisms with minimal code changes.

5. **Decoupling of the Data Layer:** Repositories decouple the data layer from the rest of the application. This means that changes in the database schema or underlying data storage do not directly affect the business logic, providing a more robust and resilient application structure.

### Implementing the Repository Pattern in Tunify Platform

In the Tunify Platform, the Repository Pattern has been implemented to manage data access for entities such as Users, Playlists, Songs, and Artists. This has improved the modularity of the application by allowing data operations to be handled in a consistent and centralized manner through repositories.

For each entity (User, Playlist, Song, and Artist), a corresponding repository interface and its implementation were created. The controllers were refactored to interact with these repositories instead of directly with the `DbContext`. This approach has simplified the code in the controllers and made the application more modular and easier to test.
